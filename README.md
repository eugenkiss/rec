Rec - The Accompanying Implementation of my Bachelor Thesis
===========================================================

As the title suggest this is the project I've created for my bachelor thesis. It
contains compilers for the languages **REC** and **GOTO** where REC is a
functional language I designed and GOTO is a turing-complete language introduced
in Uwe Sch√∂ning's Book "Theoretische Informatik - kurzgefasst". The assignment
was to devise a functional programming language and to show that it is
equivalent in power, or more specifically in terms of computability, to a Turing
Machine by giving a translation from REC to GOTO and vice versa.

All the necessary information regarding the installation and additional
information can be found in the
[documentation](http://www.eugenkiss.com/projects/rec/doc.pdf) and in my
[bachelor thesis](http://www.eugenkiss.com/projects/rec/bachelor.pdf).
Both are in German.

A word of warning: unfortunately I'm not quite pleased with some parts of
the source code. So please don't expect any elegance.
